# Profile Catalog

## Starter Profile Catalog

This document collects the starter profiles documented today.

- This list is not exhaustive.
- Repositories outside this list can still be handled by combining core skills and ecosystem references.
- Only combinations that recur are promoted to named profiles.
- Profile rules that the validator infers directly are added for the representative combinations first.
- Repository signals and selection criteria are owned by `profile-composition.md`.
- Starter `mise.toml` samples are owned by `profile-examples.md` and `examples/`.
